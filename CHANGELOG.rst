Change log
==========

Next version
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug where the link mark wasn't applied correctly. The buggy 0.10.0
  package has been yanked.
- Applied the ``--prose-editor-background`` and ``--prose-editor-foreground``
  CSS variables to the ProseMirror editing area.
- Fixed the django-content-editor support tweak where an empty label would make
  the editor move to the left border.
- Updated Tiptap.


0.10 (2024-12-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed the editor foundation to use `Tiptap <https://tiptap.dev/>__` and
  bundled many of the available extensions. Tiptap uses ProseMirror under the
  hood, but offers an extension framework which I'd have to reinvent and
  there's really no point to do that. The change should be backwards compatible
  if you only used the Python-level integration. The JavaScript integration has
  changed a lot, ``DjangoProseEditor.createEditor`` doesn't exist anymore.
- Introduced support for presets. See the "Customization" heading in the
  README.
- Introduced hidden menu buttons; it's now possible to show and hide buttons
  depending upon the editor selection.
- Fixed a misbehavior where the ``ProseEditorFormField`` would override a
  manually defined ``ProseEditorWidget``.
- Added a dependency on `django-js-asset
  <https://pypi.org/project/django-js-asset/>__` for our JavaScript and JSON
  shipping needs.
- Changed the way editor dialogs are built from unsafe ``innerHTML``
  manipulation to proper DOM manipulation.
- Updated the pre-commit hooks.
- Updated the bundled material icons font.
- Made the ESBuild watch mode report build successes again.


0.9 (2024-10-30)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated the ProseMirror dependencies.
- Added Python 3.13 to the CI matrix.
- Disable interactions and the menubar on the editor when the textarea is
  ``disabled``.


0.8 (2024-08-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Made the link button only active when the cursor is inside a link.
- Added docs on read the docs.
- Updated the ProseMirror dependencies.
- Added extremely hacky german translations for the dialogs.
- Added Django 5.1 to the CI matrix.
- Allowed specifying the heading levels for the menu. The schema itself supports
  all heading levels (1-6) as before.


0.7 (2024-08-02)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added the ``django-prose-editor[sanitize]`` which automatically installs the
  ``nh3`` dependency. Thanks @plenaerts!
- Properly restored the textarea element when destroying the editor.
- Added more unittesting.
- Supported using the ``ProseEditorFormField`` with widget instances, not just
  with widget classes.
- Documented the CSS custom properties. Thanks @carltongibson!
- Converted the block type dropdown back to a button group.
- Changed the CSS so that block type buttons look active instead of disabled
  when in a block of the respective type.
- Stopped showing the 'remove link' button as active when inside a link -- it's
  not active, just enabled.
- Improved the styles of the dialog a bit.


0.6 (2024-07-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added support for highlighting soft hyphens.
- Updated all dependencies.
- Moved the Django administration interface CSS overrides into their own file,
  and only load them if necessary so that using the editor outside the admin
  requires using  less ``!important`` overrides.


0.5 (2024-07-08)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated all dependencies.
- Stopped putting anything into the global scope in ``init.js``.
- Added support for showing typographic characters.
- Changed the editor initialization to make the initial ``textarea`` a child of
  the ``.prose-editor`` div, and changed the CSS to ``display: none
  !important;`` so that the ``textarea`` is only shown in exceptional
  circumstances, when people really really want it.


0.4 (2024-05-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Allowed installing the package in Python 3.10 environments too.
- Tweaked the cleaning methods of ``ProseEditorField`` and
  ``SanitizedProseEditorField`` to produce empty strings when no content is
  entered. Previously they would produce an empty paragraph (``<p></p>``) since
  our ProseMirror schema says that there exists always one or more block nodes.
- Stopped setting a black color on the ``.ProseMirror`` class by default.
- Dropped the dependency on ``admin/js/jquery.init.js``. We're using our own
  DOM-ready handler and therefore can still access ``django.jQuery`` to hook up
  the inline events handler if running inside the Django admin.
- Moved the paragraph formats into a popover.


0.3 (2024-04-09)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Made the editor usable in dark mode.
- Changed the cancel buttons in dialogs to not validate the form.
- Switched the ``SanitizedProseEditorField`` from html-sanitizer (which at the
  moment uses the problematic lxml HTML cleaner under the hood) with `nh3
  <https://nh3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. html-sanitizer is still a good
  choice but since we build on ProseMirror we only require a sanitizer, we
  don't have to clean up strange HTML.
- Added customization options to the fields and widgets.


0.2 (2024-03-12)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Extended the README.
- Fixed the initialization in Django admin inlines.
- Added a server-side sanitization callback to the ``ProseEditorField``, and
  added ``django_prose_editor.sanitized.SanitizedProseEditorField`` which
  automatically does the right thing.
- Automatically added a ``get_*_excerpt`` model method to models using the
  ``ProseEditorField`` as a convenience.
- Cleaned up the styles.
- Added a maximum width to the editor.
- Started hiding labels for prose editor fields in the Django admin if the
  label is an empty string. This looks better to me.
- Added a shortcut for adding links.
- Added a button for editing the raw HTML. This is sometimes useful.
- Stopped generating source maps unless in dev mode. I like source maps a lot
  in general, but the files are really big in this case.
- Added a button to the menu to insert horizontal rules.
- Added material icons for the format bar.
- Added client side validation to dialogs.
- Upgraded esbuild.


0.1 (2024-03-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Initial public release.
